# Assignment 1: Git & GitHub

This repository contains my submission for **Assignment 1**
in the **Statistical Computing** course for the **Master’s program in Data Science** at **Addis Ababa University**. 
The assignment demonstrates fundamental Git and GitHub skills, 
including creating local repositories, making commits, pushing to remote repositories, 
and documenting work professionally using Markdown.

## Assignment Objectives
The purpose of this assignment is to:
- Create a local Git repository and make the first commit.
- Create a remote repository on GitHub.
- Synchronize the local repository with the remote repository using `push` and `pull`.
- Understand and apply the basic Git workflow: `add => commit => push`.
- Create a professional README.md file using Markdown.
- Share work publicly on GitHub.

## Steps I Followed
1. Initialized a local repository on my computer:
   ```bash
   git init
Added the provided sample data script to the repository.

Staged and committed the files:

bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Add sample data script"
Created a remote repository on GitHub.

Linked the local repository to the remote repository:

bash
Copy code
git remote add origin https://github.com/Deboteka/Deborah_Statistical-Computing-Assignment-1
Pushed the local repository to GitHub:

bash
Copy code
git push -u origin main
Verified the commit history with git log (screenshot included) to ensure at least 2 commits.

Updated the README.md file to document all steps clearly.

Repository Contents

Expected Outcome
By completing this assignment, I have successfully:

Created a valid and public GitHub repository.

Added the sample data script to the repository.

Demonstrated at least 2 commits in Git history.

Created a professional README.md file using Markdown.
